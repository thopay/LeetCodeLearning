## What is this?
This is a folder from my Obsidian vault that will document my progress as I get more familiar with LeetCode. I've created this as a way to hold myself accountable and create somewhere for me to track my progress.

## Q/As
**Q**: How come the formatting looks so weird on GitHub?

**A**: This is because I write these notes with Obsidian backlinks and formatting in mind. This means when I link a note (e.g. [[HashSet]]), within my vault, I can easily click it and visit my notes on HashSets, but this doesn't translate perfectly to GitHub since GitHub doesn't know how to link files relative to the repo.

**Q**: How am I learning / getting better at LeetCoding?

**A**: Currently, I'm working through [NeetCode.io](https://neetcode.io)'s roadmap of learning. The full checklist and order of what I'll be learning can be found on [[🏠 Coding Interviews]]. All of the "tools" and "methods" I learn to solve different problems will be put into the "Tools and Methods" folder. For each subject from NeetCode, I will be creating a section for each problem and documenting my knowledge and ideas related to each one. I think using Obsidian is a perfect method for learning something like this since it's extremely intuitive to create backlinks (links between notes) and see how each idea builds on one another.
