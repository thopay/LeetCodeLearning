# Figma Interview Form

1. Briefly explain a project that highlights your programming skills. Was this from a past internship, through university, a personal project, etc?

This past year I've been working as the Executive Web Designer for the Iowa State TREND Fashion Magazine. When I initially joined, the club was attempting to bolster its online presence, and I decided to throw my hat in the ring to help them design and develop a new website. I started by putting together a mockup in Figma, which went through various iterations and revisions based on feedback from the Editors-In-Chief. I continued development by translating the mockup to a Next.JS website, utilizing React and Tailwind CSS. While doing so, I also created a GraphQL, Strapi, and Postgres backend, allowing club members to dynamically add new content like older magazine editions, announcements, and editorials. The website is currently available at [https://www.trendmagisu.com/](https://www.trendmagisu.com/ "https://www.trendmagisu.com/
(https://www.trendmagisu.com/)").

2. In the application question, you selected being more interested in a niche team (Infra, Security, Native) or a Product (GenSWE) team. Please let us know why!

I selected Desktop and Mobile Apps for the application question. I'm unsure if that implies working on Figma itself, but that is my current goal. Figma has been part of my workflow for nearly four years. I am personally invested in its improvement, and I'm eager to contribute to its evolution. I've been privileged to witness Figma's continued refinement and growth, and I have full confidence in its value as a design tool. I am passionate about UI/UX design and recognize Figma as a leading innovator. The possibility of directly influencing the tool's evolution from within the Figma team would be an awesome opportunity for growth and contribution.

3. What are your top three priorities in choosing a company you would like to join?

First and foremost, it's important for me to invest my time and energy into a product that I truly care about (Figma is a perfect fit in this regard). I strongly believe that work is much more fulfilling when I genuinely care about the end result. Secondly, a strong sense of community within the workplace is crucial to me. Collaboration and strong relationships foster innovative solutions and make the workplace much more enjoyable. Finally, despite being dedicated to a product and enthusiastic about my work, I am a firm believer in maintaining a healthy work-life balance. Don't get me wrong, I love working on something I care about, but as a software engineer, the last thing I want is to be burned out. Ideally, my dream company would care about these three things as much as I do.

4. Do you currently have any offers and/or any deadlines I should be sensitive of?

Yes, I presently have an offer from Walmart for a Software Engineer Intern position for the Summer of 2024. While I appreciate their offer, I am certainly open to exploring opportunities that more closely align with my passion for UI/UX design, like with Figma.

5. Are you open to working in San Francisco, New York, or either?

Either

# Study Schedule

## **Week 1 - Coding Interview prep - Algorithms and Data Structures**

### **Day 1-3: Array and Strings**
  - Read about and understand these data structures. Ensure you know how to manipulate strings and familiarize yourself with array operations. Solve at least 5-7 LeetCode problems related to these topics each day.

**Written Problems**
1. Is Unique: Implement an algorithm to determine if a string has all unique characters. What if you cannot use additional data structures?

2. Check Permutation: Given two strings, write a method to decide if one is a permutation of the other
### **Day 4-5: Linked List**
  - Understand the concept, how it works and its use-cases. Practice 5-7 linked list related problems on LeetCode each day.

### **Day 6: Stack & Queues**
  - Grasp the concept, working and applications. Attempt 5-7 stack/queue related problems on LeetCode.

### **Day 7: Rest**
  - Take a break. Rest or revise what you've learned so far.

## **Week 2 - Deepen Coding skills and All-around Interview Prep**

### **Day 8-9: Trees and Graphs**
  - Spend more time on these as they are more complex. Understand their concepts, traversals, etc. Practice 5-7 tree and graph problems on LeetCode each day.

### **Day 10: Dynamic Programming**
  - Understand the concept of memozation and tabulation. Try out 5-7 dynamic programming problems on LeetCode.

### **Day 11-12: Conceptual understanding and System Design**
  - Brush up your knowledge on important concepts like OS, DBMS, OOPS. Get a basic understanding of system design. LeetCode does not have these topics so you might have to use other online resources.

### **Day 13: Behavioral Questions and Company Research**
  - Prepare for the "Tell me about yourself" and "Why should we hire you?" questions. Other behavioral questions could revolve around your understanding and interpretation of team work, handling pressure and failure etc. Research about Figma, their products, achievements, and any recent news.

### **Day 14: Rest**
  - Relax. Go through anything that you think needs a revisit. Get a good amount of sleep before interview days.

Remember, understanding the problem and solution is more important than finishing a large number of problems. All the best!
