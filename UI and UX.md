1. **Design Principles**: Become familiar with fundamental design principles, such as alignment, balance, contrast, repetition, proximity, and hierarchy. Understand how these principles contribute towards effective visual design.

2. **Wireframing**: Wireframes are simple layout diagrams that display the size and location of page elements, site features, conversion areas, and more. Knowing the basics of wireframing to communicate functionalities, content, and user flow can be beneficial.

3. **Prototyping**: This is an experimental process where design teams implement ideas into tangible forms for testing. Familiarizing yourself with the prototyping process can be a real advantage.

4. **UI Design**: Elements such as color scheme, shape, line, texture, typography, and form all play crucial parts in a design's effectiveness. A basic understanding of these elements and how they're used in interface design would be useful.

5. **UX Design**: Learn about UX strategies and methodologies like defining user personas, creating user flows, performing user testing, and more. A well-designed user interface accommodates a user-friendly experience.

6. **Responsiveness**: With the variety of devices available today, understanding how to create designs that scale and adapt to different screen sizes is pivotal.

7. **Accessibility**: Designing with accessibility in mind is a must. This can include contrasting color combinations for color blindness, larger interactive elements for motor disability, or screen reader compatibility for visual impairment.
