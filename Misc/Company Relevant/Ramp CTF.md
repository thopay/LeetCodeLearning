My most recent internship was at John Deere where I worked as a Software Engineer Intern. I played an integral role in expanding website accessibility for John Deere dealers globally by implementing new API endpoints using Java Spring and adding new React components to the dealers' dashboard. Additionally, I currently serve as the Executive Web Designer for the Iowa State University TREND Fashion Magazine. I single-handedly developed a full-stack web application from mockup to completion using Figma, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, GraphQL, Strapi, and Postgres. The website hosts the magazines editorials, previous editions, and announcements.
