### Identifying
- The problem input is a linear data structure such as a linked list, array or string
- You're asked to find the longest/shorted substring, subarray, or a desired value

### Common Problems
- Maximum sum subarray of size 'K' (easy)
- Longest substring with 'K' distinct characters (medium)
- String anagrams (hard)
