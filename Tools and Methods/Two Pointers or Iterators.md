Two Pointers is a pattern where two pointers iterate through the data structure in tandem until one or both of the pointers hit a certain condition. Two pointers is often useful when searching pars in a sorted array or linked list.

### Identifying
- It will feature problems where you deal with sorted arrays (or Linked Lists) and need to find a set of elements that fulfill certain constraints
- The set of elements in the array is a pair, a triplet, or even a subarray

### Common Problems
 - Squaring a sorted array (easy)
 - Triplets that sum to zero (medium)
 - Comparing strings that contain backspaces (medium)
