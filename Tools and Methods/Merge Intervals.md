The Merge Intervals pattern is an efficient technique to deal with overlapping intervals. In a lot of problems involving intervals, you either need to find overlapping intervals or merge intervals if they overlap

### How it works
- Given two intervals ('a' and 'b'), there will be six different ways the two intervals can relate to each other

### Identifying
- If you're asked to produce a list with only mutually exclusive intervals
- If you hear the term "overlapping intervals"

### Common Problems
- Intervals Intersection (medium)
- Maximum CPU load (hard)
