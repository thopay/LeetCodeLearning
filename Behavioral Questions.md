### Answering Behavioral Interview Questions

**1. Restate**
- Helps your brain organize & clarify the data
- Slightly change the wording to narrow the path or allow the interviewer to narrow the path

**2. Present Options**
- Ask interviewer what direction they want you to take
- This helps figure out what your interviewer **wants** to hear

**3. Situation**
- Be brief and provide detail
- 15-30 seconds

**4. Task**
- Make the interviewer understand your specific role
- 1 or 2 sentences

**5. Actions**
- At least 50% of the total answer
- Chronological and clearly defined
- Make sure each action has follow-up items/sub-items

**6. Results**
- Don't downplay results
- Make it clear
- If the results are really good (especially when it has numbers), state the results initially then go into STAR

**7. Learnings / Application of Learnings**
- Always explain and highlight what you learned
- Companies want to hire continual learners

**8. Follow Up Questions**
- Clear end to your answer
- Help you be brief initially
- Focus on what you know
- Identify themes that interest your interviewer
	- e.g. if interviewer says "tell me more about the technical," remember that for future questions since they probably want to hear more of that for any future questions

**Themes**

### Tell Me About Yourself
- Know your audience and study the room
- Take control
- Core knowledge
	- You know your strengths
	- You know a little bit about the company and the job/role their trying to fill

"My core strengths/skills are A, B, C, but as you think about the role, is there any specific strength you'd like me to focus on today? I want to make sure I'm giving you the best insight to me to help you figure out whether I'm the right person for the role"
- Asks the interviewer what they want to hear

**Specific Example**
"I'm currently a Software Engineering student at Iowa State University with a minor in Cyber Security. I've had the opportunity to work as an intern at both John Deere and PeachPay, where I've learned a ton about software development and how to work effectively in team environments. On top of that, I've also led some cool projects in school, like the TREND Magazine Website and SpamGram, where I got to dive deep into UI and UX design.

In terms of my skills, I think several strengths set me apart. Firstly, I bring a robust knowledge of front-end programming languages like JavaScript and React. Secondly, I have a lot of experience with implementing API endpoints and improving website accessibility. Lastly, I've honed my abilities in UI/UX design, which can be seen through the variety of projects I've participated in throughout my college career.

Before we continue though, I want to make sure that I'm giving you the best insight into my skills. Is there a specific strength or skill you're especially curious about or want me to focus on in our conversation today? It's important to me that you have a complete understanding of my qualifications to gauge if I'd be an ideal fit for your UI Software Engineer role at Jump Trading."
